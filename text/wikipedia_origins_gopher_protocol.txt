"Thinking of it like that, a method of easily serving directories
of data, rather than a scaled down web makes the whole thing more
appealing I think." -- Quote attributed to Rob Sayers

The following text is from the "origins" section on Wikipedia's page on the
Gopher Protocol:

The Gopher system was released in mid-1991 by Mark P. McCahill, Farhad
Anklesaria, Paul Lindner, Daniel Torrey, and Bob Alberti of the University of
Minnesota in the United States. Its central goals were, as stated in RFC 1436:

  * A file-like hierarchical arrangement that would be familiar to users.
  * A simple syntax.
  * A system that can be created quickly and inexpensively.
  * Extensibility of the file system metaphor; allowing addition of searches for example.

Gopher combines document hierarchies with collections of services, including
WAIS, the Archie and Veronica search engines, and gateways to other information
systems such as File Transfer Protocol (FTP) and Usenet.

The general interest in campus-wide information systems (CWISs) in higher
education at the time, and the ease of setup of Gopher servers to create an
instant CWIS with links to other sites' online directories and resources, were
the factors contributing to Gopher's rapid adoption.

The name was coined by Anklesaria as a play on several meanings of the word
"gopher". The University of Minnesota mascot is the gopher,[8] a gofer is an
assistant who "goes for" things, and a gopher burrows through the ground to
reach a desired location.
